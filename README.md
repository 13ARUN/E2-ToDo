# To-Do List

A simple, interactive To-Do List web application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks. The application stores tasks in `localStorage` and provides features such as task filtering, task count, and notifications for task management.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks through an input form.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks (excluding completed tasks).
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete individual tasks or clear tasks based on their status (all, in-progress, completed).
- **Task Filtering**: Tasks can be filtered by status: all, in-progress, or completed.
- **Task Count**: A dynamic display shows the total number of tasks, in-progress tasks, or completed tasks based on the selected filter.
- **Notifications and Toasts**: Notifications and confirmation toasts are used to inform users about successful actions or to confirm critical actions.
